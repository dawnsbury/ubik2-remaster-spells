This mod implements many of the Remaster spells.
Some of these are essentially just a rename of existing spells, but many have new functionality.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
[list]
 [*]The escape DC for Tangle Vine uses your skill rather than your spell DC. There is no option to escape the slow effect (it would be a poor option).
 [*]Concordant Choir has the Manipulate trait for the 1 action variant (should only apply to the 2 and 3 action variants).
 [*]Thunderstrike doesn't have any extra effect for foes in metal armor or made of metal.
 [*]Floating Flame rolls damage for each target, instead of using a shared damage roll for each Sustain action.
 [*]Revealing Light will have some unexpected interactions when Invisibility wears off before Revealing Light. Creatures will continue to be concealed.
 [*]Moonbeam doesn't do Silver damage.
 [*]Spirit damage will be effective against constructs. Spiritual Armament does Good damage instead of possibly Sanctified Spirit damage.
 [*]Sorcerer Bloodlines and Deities are updated in the RemasterFeats mod, but if that isn't installed, the old ones have not been updated to reference the new spells.
 [*]Wizard schools are updated in the RemasterFeats mod, but if that isn't installed, since Remaster spells don't have the school trait, they won't qualify for the old school slots.
 [*]Earthworks doesn't let you interact from an adjacent square to remove the effect. It also doesn't apply to flying creatures even when heightened.

[h2]Replacements[/h2]
When a replacement spell has a different name, the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3223762737]Remaster Spells[/url] mod leaves the legacy spell in the game.
The [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3229964986]Remaster Spells - Hide Legacy[/url] mod hides the legacy versions of the spell. Because of this, existing characters will need to have their spells updated to work with that mod.
If you want the remaster spells, and don't want the replaced versions, you should use both mods.
