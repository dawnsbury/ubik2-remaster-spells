This mod hides the Legacy spells that have a Remaster version with a different name.
This will likely require you to update spell selections for the starting characters (or any characters in your saved game).

[h2]Replacements[/h2]
When a replacement spell has a different name, the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3223762737]Remaster Spells[/url] mod leaves the legacy spell in the game.
The [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3229964986]Remaster Spells - Hide Legacy[/url] mod hides the legacy versions of the spell. Because of this, existing characters will need to have their spells updated to work with that mod.
If you want the remaster spells, and don't want the replaced versions, you should use both mods.
