This mod adds the Commander and Guardian classes from the Battlecry! playtest.
The Guardian can be used now, but the Commander doesn't have enough implemented to be very useful yet.

[h2]Guardian[/h2]
[h3]Features[/h3]
[list]
 [*] Guardian's Armor - the chain specialization is not implemented
 [*] Intercept Strike - some limitations with resistance and weakness
 [*] Taunt - bonus/penalty only applies to attack rolls; doesn't change the AI behavior
 [*] Reactive Shield
 [*] Unkind Shove
 [*] Long-Distance Taunt
 [*] Hampering Sweeps - this just reduces the speed to 5'
 [*] Raise Haft
 [*] Shielding Taunt
 [*] Flying Tackle - leap is just a 15' stride
 [*] Intercept Energy
