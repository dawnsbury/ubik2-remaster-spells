This mod adds the Commander and Guardian classes from the Battlecry! playtest.
The Guardian can be used now, but the Commander doesn't have enough implemented to be very useful yet.

[h2]Guardian[/h2]
[h3]Features[/h3]
[list]
 [*] Guardian's Armor - the chain specialization is not implemented
 [*] Intercept Strike - some limitations with resistance and weakness
 [*] Taunt - bonus/penalty only applies to attack rolls; doesn't change the AI behavior
 [*] Reactive Shield
 [*] Unkind Shove
 [*] Long-Distance Taunt
 [*] Hampering Sweeps - this just reduces the speed to 5'
 [*] Raise Haft
 [*] Shielding Taunt
 [*] Flying Tackle - leap is just a 15' stride
 [*] Intercept Energy
[/list]

[h3]Missing Features[/h3]
[list]
 [*] Ferocious Vengeance - I probably won't do this one
 [*] Mitigate Harm - Not sure how to deal with this
 [*] Bodyguard
 [*] Larger Than Life - not useful in game
 [*] Shoulder Check
 [*] Tough to Kill - daily benefit of dying 3 to dying 2 isn't implemented
 [*] Armor Break - I probably won't do this one
 [*] Covering Stance - requires more investigation
 [*] Area Cover
 [*] Averting Shield - not useful in game
 [*] Intercept Foe - requires more investigation
 [*] Shielded Attrition - I probably won't do this one
[/list]

[h2]Commander[/h2]
[h3]Features[/h3]
[list]
 [*] Commander's Banner - this is just an emanation from the character, and the other modes aren't available
 [*] Drilled Reactions - this will automatically be used if it is available
 [*] Form Up!
 [*] Pincer Attack
 [*] Strike Hard!
 [*] Combat Medic
 [*] Deceptive Tactics
 [*] Commander's Steed - this is implemented as a standard animal companion with the same choices as the Ranger and Druid.
[/list]

[h3]Missing Features[/h3]
[list]
 [*] Armored Regiment Training - not useful in game
 [*] Most of the tactics are missing (other than Form Up!, Pincer Attack, and Strike Hard!)
 [*] Form Up! does not require squadmates to end their turn within the banner radius
 [*] Combat Assessment - not useful in game, since this info is already available
 [*] Deceptive Tactics - you don't gain the Lengthy Diversion feat, since that's not useful in the game. The ability to use Warfare Lore applies to all uses of Deception (though only Create a Diversion and Feint are options in the game).
 [*] Plant Banner - I'm not going to implement the variant banner systems
 [*] Commander's Steed - the banner functionality isn't included, and mounts are not supported.
 [*] Adaptive Stratagem - not useful enough in game -- while the campaign doesn't let you swap tactics freely, you can in free encounter mode
 [*] Defensive Swap
 [*] Guiding Shot
 [*] Set-up Strike
 [*] Tactical Expansion - to avoid a tactic preparation interface, I only allow the two tactics
 [*] Rapid Assessment - not useful in game, since this info is already available
 [*] Banner Twirl - not implemented, since there's no easy way to grant concealment only vs. ranged attacks
 [*] Observational Knowledge - not useful in game, since this info is already available
 [*] Shielded Recovery
 [*] Unsteady Strike
 [*] Wave the Flag
